# change-server-icons

A simple [Powercord](https://powercord.dev) theme to change the icons of any servers of the user's choice everywhere they appear in the Discord client.

To add/remove servers, edit the SCSS dictionary at the top of `main.scss`. Each entry consists of the server's ID and the URL of the image to use in place of the server's own icon.
